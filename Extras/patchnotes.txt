RESEARCH DIFFERENT LITERATURE
STUDIED JAVA - FRAMEWORKS - CODE DEFENDERS - JAVA VM - TOO SLOW - BACKEND JAVA -
FAKE RUN JAVA BY FILL IN BOXES AND IF STATEMENTS 
STUDY STYLE OF WEBSITE - USE TEMPLATE - EDIT IT 
BASIC HTML PAGE FOR JAVASCRIPT - TRIED USING JEST - NODE JS - REQUIRES TERMINAL
- DETERMINE IF HTML JS COMMAND CAN BOOT AND RUN THE TERMINAL - REQUIRE IT TO USE WEBSITE
- NODEJS - ALL DEPENDENCIES - JEST 
TRIED STRYKE - EXPANSION FROM JEST - USEFUL BUT SAME DRAWBACK
USING JASMINE - SUCCESS RUNS THROUGH BROWSER - JASMINE QUICKSTART TEMPLATE - CHANGE HTML
STYLE - ADD USER INPUT - READ AND STORE IN VARIABLE - THEN STORE TO JS FILE
USING EJS TEMPLATE ENGINE 
- RUN JS FILE ON PAGE FOR TEST TO RUN AGAINST JS FILE - TROUBLE - IN USE WONT EDIT - TRY
RELOAD PAGE - TRY BUTTON TO WRITE CODE 
JASMINE - BROWSER- TEMPLATE - WRITE JS TEST FILE FOR NEW HTML PAGE - WONT BE IN USE
SUCCESS - CREATE IFRAME AS VARIABLE - STORE INSIDE VARIABLE AND OUTPUT TO TEXTBOX
USE INDEX HTML FORMATTING FOR TESTING PAGE 
CREATED SERVER NODE JS - ONLY SERVES STATIC HTML FILE
USING EXPRESS - INSTALLED NODEMON FOR CODE TRACKING - SHOWS HTML CSS JS 
NOW CREATING DATABASE - USING PASSPORTJS WITH BCRYPTJS - COULDNT INSTALL MONGOCOMPASS
- INSTALL JUST MONGODB - CANT RUN SERVICE - FIXED BY REMOVING FILES AND REINSTALLING SERVICE
- USING MONGOOSEJS
CREATED LOGIN PAGE AND REGISTER PAGE - USING BCRYPT, LOCAL DATABASE - LOGINAPP
DESIGNED IN HANDLEBARS - SWITCHED TO EJS FOR TESTER - FLASH MESSAGES WONT RENDER
TOOK FOREVER BUT FOUND IN CONSOLE LOG- OUTPUTS AS PARAM,MSG,VALUE - DISPLAYS OBJECT OBJECT
RUN FOR LOOP TO GET MSG VALUE AND STORE INTO FLASH MESSAGE
TRIED HIGHLIGHTJS - STATIC UNEDITABLE, TRIED ACE BUT DIFFICULTIES 
EDIT USER PROFILE - COMPLETED - USER.FINDONE + USER.SAVE
DESIGN POINT SCORING SYSTEM - USERDB CONTAIN POINTS FIELD (POSSIBLY BE MADE INTO ARRAY)
BUTTON TO CHECK IFRAME CONTENTS - FIND DIV BY CLASS - SEARCH INNERHTML WITH [0] TO CHECK
IF FAILED - WORKS - GO TO SAVEGAME PAGE TO RELOAD PAGE AND STORE CHANGES TO POINTS
CREATE SCENARIO PAGE - DISPLAY SCORES - TEN EASY GAMES FOR FIRST SCENARIO
CREATED SCENARIO PAGE - REDIRECT TO SCENARIO 
ENSURE CORRECT MUTANT KILLED - TEST ORIGINAL AGAINST MUTATED - TWO IFRAMES, ONE HIDDEN
WITH ORIGINAL CODE - TESTS AGAINST EACHOTHER
CREATE YOUR OWN SCENARIO - OWN TABLE CC - STORE ORIGINAL CODE, MUTATION, EXPLANATION,
AND SOLUTION - MUST FIRST BE VERIFIED TO WORK BEFORE ABLE TO UPLOAD
CREATED ADMIN TABLE - ADMIN SITE INDEPENDENT OF USER SITE, PORT - INCASE OF EXPANSION
ADMIN SITE - CONTROLS - LOGIN --> CREATE SCENARIOS, APPROVE CREATED SCENARIOS
VIEW USERS
BTNCLICK - ACCESS NEW TABLE FOR SCENARIOS - INPUT INTO RS AND ORS VARIABLES FOR EASE
ADDED ALL SCENARIOS THROUGH ADMIN SITE - NO NEED FOR MANUAL INPUT - LOTS OF CODE
REDUCED - FINDS ALL DATA SERVER SIDE THEN RENDERS THE SITE WITH ALL RECORDS
USE FOREACH LOOP TO STORE EACH RECORD IN HIDDEN HEADERS WITH SAME CLASSNAME
USE CLASSNAME AND .INNERTEXT TO GRAB THE RECORDS AND STORE IN AN ARRAY
GRAB RECORD ACCORDINGLY FROM ARRAY AND USE IT TO RUN THE TEST FOR EACH SCENARIO
LOCATION STILL USED TO DETERMINE SCENARIO NUMBER AND LETTER - CLEANER CODE
ACE EDITOR NOW WORKING - RUN SCRIPT ON PAGE - EDITOR.GETVALUE() TO GRAB THE TEXT WITHIN
FORM INPUT BECAME UNDEFINED DUE TO ACE EDITOR TYPE - USED HIDDEN INPUT FIELDS
- WHEN VERIFYING SCENARIO THE INPUT FIELDS ARE FILLED WITH EDITORS VALUES TO BE SENT OFF
INSTEAD
CREATED SCENARIOS - BEGINNER INTERMEDIATE ADV
WRITE TEST CODE + FIND THE MUTANT
ADMIN CONTROL TABLES FOR EACH 
BTNCLICK - FUNCTIONALITY TO ADD POINTS
ALSO TO RUN FIND THE MUTANT - CHANGED CODE
ROUTES MODELS ADDED AND CHANGED FOR EACH TABLE
ADMIN ABLE TO ADD DETAILS TO EACH TABLE
HOW TO PLAY MANUAL - COMPLETE FOR TWO GAME TYPES + YOUTUBE TUTORIAL
