RESEARCH DIFFERENT LITERATURE
STUDIED JAVA - FRAMEWORKS - CODE DEFENDERS - JAVA VM - TOO SLOW - BACKEND JAVA -
FAKE RUN JAVA BY FILL IN BOXES AND IF STATEMENTS 
STUDY STYLE OF WEBSITE - USE TEMPLATE - EDIT IT 
BASIC HTML PAGE FOR JAVASCRIPT - TRIED USING JEST - NODE JS - REQUIRES TERMINAL
- DETERMINE IF HTML JS COMMAND CAN BOOT AND RUN THE TERMINAL - REQUIRE IT TO USE WEBSITE
- NODEJS - ALL DEPENDENCIES - JEST 
TRIED STRYKE - EXPANSION FROM JEST - USEFUL BUT SAME DRAWBACK
USING JASMINE - SUCCESS RUNS THROUGH BROWSER - JASMINE QUICKSTART TEMPLATE - CHANGE HTML
STYLE - ADD USER INPUT - READ AND STORE IN VARIABLE - THEN STORE TO JS FILE
USING EJS TEMPLATE ENGINE 
- RUN JS FILE ON PAGE FOR TEST TO RUN AGAINST JS FILE - TROUBLE - IN USE WONT EDIT - TRY
RELOAD PAGE - TRY BUTTON TO WRITE CODE 
JASMINE - BROWSER- TEMPLATE - WRITE JS TEST FILE FOR NEW HTML PAGE - WONT BE IN USE
SUCCESS - CREATE IFRAME AS VARIABLE - STORE INSIDE VARIABLE AND OUTPUT TO TEXTBOX
USE INDEX HTML FORMATTING FOR TESTING PAGE 
CREATED SERVER NODE JS - ONLY SERVES STATIC HTML FILE
USING EXPRESS - INSTALLED NODEMON FOR CODE TRACKING - SHOWS HTML CSS JS 
NOW CREATING DATABASE - USING PASSPORTJS WITH BCRYPTJS - COULDNT INSTALL MONGOCOMPASS
- INSTALL JUST MONGODB - CANT RUN SERVICE - FIXED BY REMOVING FILES AND REINSTALLING SERVICE
- USING MONGOOSEJS
CREATED LOGIN PAGE AND REGISTER PAGE - USING BCRYPT, LOCAL DATABASE - LOGINAPP
DESIGNED IN HANDLEBARS - SWITCHED TO EJS FOR TESTER - FLASH MESSAGES WONT RENDER
TOOK FOREVER BUT FOUND IN CONSOLE LOG- OUTPUTS AS PARAM,MSG,VALUE - DISPLAYS OBJECT OBJECT
RUN FOR LOOP TO GET MSG VALUE AND STORE INTO FLASH MESSAGE
TRIED HIGHLIGHTJS - STATIC UNEDITABLE, TRIED ACE BUT DIFFICULTIES 
EDIT USER PROFILE - COMPLETED - USER.FINDONE + USER.SAVE
DESIGN POINT SCORING SYSTEM - USERDB CONTAIN POINTS FIELD (POSSIBLY BE MADE INTO ARRAY)
BUTTON TO CHECK IFRAME CONTENTS - FIND DIV BY CLASS - SEARCH INNERHTML WITH [0] TO CHECK
IF FAILED - WORKS - GO TO SAVEGAME PAGE TO RELOAD PAGE AND STORE CHANGES TO POINTS
CREATE SCENARIO PAGE - DISPLAY SCORES - TEN EASY GAMES FOR FIRST SCENARIO
CREATED SCENARIO PAGE - REDIRECT TO SCENARIO 
ENSURE CORRECT MUTANT KILLED - TEST ORIGINAL AGAINST MUTATED - TWO IFRAMES, ONE HIDDEN
WITH ORIGINAL CODE - TESTS AGAINST EACHOTHER
