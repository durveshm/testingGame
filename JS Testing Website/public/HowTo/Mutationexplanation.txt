1. Make sure you are logged in. Select the play button on the homepage.
2. Select the 'Find The Mutant' game mode.
3. Select the scenario, we will pick 1.
4. Here is the same layout as the previous game mode but slightly altered. We now have
   our mutation code to begin with, followed by an explanation and lastly, the text 
   editor to fix the code. The difference with this game mode is for you to find the 
   mutant in the code given, and rewrite the code as it should have been originally.
5. The code returns the filename extension and so searches for the '.' to grab the 
   extension. In the code we see that it instead looks for 'h'. Modifying this line
   should result in passing the test case.
6. Upon running the code, we find the test case passes. The code has been restored.
   But wait? What is making sure the code written is correct? Well there is a test case
   that will only work if the code does as it should and so will be tested against the 
   text editor code when ran.
